## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (at least version 6) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ node -v && npm -v
v10.15.1
6.9.0
```

You may also want to install Serverless globally on your local machine for accessing the
CLI functionality and directly interact with your deployed Lambda function.

To install Serverless globally on your machine, run the following command

```sh
$ npm i -g serverless
```

Please, read the [official Serverless documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)
to know more about the installation process.

If you want to deploy your code to AWS, then you will also need an AWS account and
[set-up your provider credentials](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/)

## Optional requisites

This project is making use of Serverless and Docker.
They are both optionals however Docker will be required for deploying your local code
to Lambda if you are not running this project from a Linux machine.
Read the [Docker](#docker) section to know more about.

### Installation

Start with cloning this repo on your local machine:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/andreasonny83/serverless-image-rendering.git
$ cd serverless-image-rendering
```

Then install all the Node dependencies using npm or Yarn

```sh
$ npm install
# Or using Yarn for a faster installation
$ yarn
```

### Images Bucket

This project is making use of a pre-existing S3 bucket from where fetching
the images to be processed and deliver to the client.
If you don't have an S3 already, create one from your AWS dashboard and
continue reading the [Environment configuration](#environment-configuration)
section.

## Usage

### Environment configuration

This project contains a `serverless.sample.yml` file.
You need to manually renamed it to `serverless.yml`.
In order for your application to be correctly deployed to AWS, you will need to
replace the `BUCKET` name under the `environment` section according to your S3
bucket name previously created.

### dotENV

For your local development you will need a `.env` file containing your S3 bucket name.
Rename the `.env.sample` file in this project to be `.env` first, then replace the
`your-s3-bucket-name` placeholder with the correct name of your S3 Bucket.

### Serving the app

```sh
$ npm run serve
```

This will run the Lambda function locally using `serverless-offline`.

### Resizing your images

While running your local app, open a browser to
[`http://localhost:3000/resize-image?status`](http://localhost:3000/resize-image?status)

You should be able to see a JSON information to prove that your app is actually
up and running.

You can then replace the `?status` endpoint with your image information.

`http://localhost:3000/resize-image?f=FILE-NAME&w=WIDTH&h=HEIGHT&q=QUALITY&t=TYPE`

| Query string name  | Type   | Required | Description |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `f`                | String | Yes      | The complete image name uploaded to your S3 bucket (eg. placeholder.jpg)
| `w`                | Number | No       | The image width
| `h`                | Number | No       | The image height
| `q`                | Number | No       | The image quality (between 1-100)
| `t`                | String | No       | The image type (default is webp) Available values are [webp, jpeg and png]

Note. If the Type is different from your original image type, it will
automatically be converted into the new format.

**Example**

`http://localhost:3000/resize-image?f=placeholder.png&w=600&q=75&t=jpeg`

Assuming that you have an image called `placeholder.png` on your S3 bucket:


### Unit testing

```sh
$ npm test
```

This is using Jest framework.
If you want to keep running Jest in the background and watch for file change while developing
use the following npm command instead:

```sh
$ npm run test:watch
```

### Docker

The `Make install` command will run `npm install` from inside a Docker
container to reproduce the same environment configuration present on AWS Lambda.
Deploying the Lambda function after running `npm install` from your local machine
will probably result on the function returning a server error if your local machine
configuration is different from the one on AWS.

To make sure the `npm run deploy` succeeds:

1. Clean your `node_modules` folder with `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json`
1. Create the Docker image with `make build`
1. Run `npm install` from inside the Docker container with `make install`
1. Then run serverless deploy` with `npm run deploy`

## Deployment

1. Install serverless globally
1. Make sure you have correctly set up your AWS credentials
1. Install the Node dependencies with Docker by running `make build` to generate
the Docker image, the run `make install` (This will run `npm install` from inside
the Docker container using the same environment setup running on AWS)
1. run `npm run deploy` to deploy your function to AWS Lambda

## Log

Note. The following commands will require Serverless to be globally
installed on your machine. Please read the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
section for more information.

When your Lambda function has been deployed, you will be able to
easily log all the events directly inside your local terminal.

```sh
$ sls logs -f {function-name} -t
```

If you don't remember what's your function name, you can easily retrieve
all your Lambda information running the following command from inside your
project's directory.

```sh
$ sls info
```
